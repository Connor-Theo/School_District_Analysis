# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
	The purpose of this analysis was to help the school board accurately decide how much money should be allocated to each school in the district. The metrics we used were based on math & reading scores for each high school and high school grade (9-12).  

## Results:
	The results of my analysis yielded positive results for both the schools and administration, the 9th grade scores for Thomas High School were unfortunately found to have been tampered with and thus created some errors in our data.  With some data cleaning the 9th graders at Thomas High School had their scores replaced with ‘Na’.  (See image below)

#District Summary: Our district results were heavily influenced by the replacement of our 9th graders data from Thomas High School. They were an average performing school that saw a significant spike in each grade % as well as a major leap in overall passing. This forced them into the upper echelon of our district and impacted each school directly

#School Summary: The removal of 9th graders grades saw Thomas High School as one of the higher rated schools in the district, they ranked in the top 3 for math scores and reading scores putting them at #2 in overall passing percentage.

# The replacement of our 9th graders grades for Thomas High School impacted them in a major way, they went from being a middle of the pack performing school to a top 3 school. The removal of their data made a significant difference in their grades, and subsequent funding. This impact forced each school outside of Cabrera High School to move down one slot in the pecking order.

##Summary
To summarize our results, Thomas High Schools performance without the 9th grade data yielded a significant increase in their overall grades and passing percentage, leapfrogging them into the top 3 in performance and increasing their funding.  You could argue that it may not be fair to remove their scores, however, Thomas High School would be impacted severely in either case, removal or not.  The affect of the grade removal was great, and should be clearly noticed in the analysis.
